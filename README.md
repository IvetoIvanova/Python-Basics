# Python-Basics

This repository contains my initial steps in learning Python. As someone with prior experience in Java, I explored Python to understand its syntax, basic concepts, and versatility. My primary goal was to get a feel for the language and potentially demonstrate basic familiarity for future opportunities.

## Repository goals

1. **Showcase syntax familiarity**  
   Solve problems and exercises, such as exam tasks, to demonstrate a solid understanding of Python basics.
   
2. **Build small applications**  
   Develop small, practical projects to highlight Python's versatility and real-world use cases.

3. **Create a learning archive**  
   Provide organized examples for anyone interested in learning Python through practical solutions.

## Contributing
While this repository is primarily a personal learning archive, contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or would like to collaborate on small projects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
